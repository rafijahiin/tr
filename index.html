"Conclusion 1. The current Programme achieved notable cross-area gains, such as the national Violence Against Women survey, stronger MISP preparedness, and improved quality standards. However, interlinkages between the four thematic Theories of Change were not explicit, and a structured, cross-area way of working was not fully established. Interlinkage among the TOCs could open up opportunities for more integrated programming, joint adaptation, cross-fertilization, innovation, monitoring, and the consistent application of equity considerations, mitigation of demographic and climate risks, and data governance. As a result, demonstrating combined contributions to outcomes and the three Transformative Results (3TRs) is more challenging. Joint UN programming and diversified partnerships added value in policy and delivery, especially in humanitarian settings. ","The 10th Country Programme did not include a single Theory of Change, but four thematic Theories of Change. This has not facilitated systemic inter-area work but has reinforced intra-area focus.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 2"
,The absence of a unified (“umbrella”) ToC has limited system-wide adaptive responses and joint monitoring across areas—highlighting a cross-area coordination issue to address in management responses.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 2"
,"Lack of robust, documented cross-thematic integration in planning... integration is more ad hoc than systemic, particularly at sub-national levels.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 7"
,"Operational collaboration is standard in the humanitarian response (Rohingya camps) but inconsistent outside crisis contexts and often project-specific, not a core operational norm.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 7; EQ2, Claim 2"
,"Strategic platforms exist and facilitate dialogue, but budgetary/resource integration is weak; uneven resource distribution across thematic areas.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 2; EQ3, Claim 7"
,"Over 38,000 women and girls were served at 92 police desks across 10 districts in 2023.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 4"
,"In response to floods in Chattogram, UNFPA provided dignity kits, MHM kits, and baby kits to 12,000 women and 6,120 girls, including those with disabilities and transgender women.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 4"
,"With UNFPA support, the Ministry of Health integrated the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) into the 5th Health Sector Operational Plan.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 6; EQ5, Claim 10.2"
,UNFPA successfully supported the Census 2022 and VAW Survey 2024 to gather disaggregated data on marginalized populations. The Census 2022 included questions specifically targeting Persons with Disabilities (POD) and transgender populations.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ4, Claim 1"
,The Gender-based Violence Sub Sector and focal points developed a dashboard for real-time mapping and referral pathway sharing in refugee camps.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 3"
,UNFPA actively participated in and co-chaired the UN SDG data group and the UNSDCF Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) working group in 2022 and 2023.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 1; EQ4, Claim 5"
,"UNFPA led the GBV Sub-Sector, coordinating 67 partner organizations across 33 camps and 11 host communities to enhance interagency GBV case management and service coordination.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 5"
,"UNFPA co-created a common beneficiary database with WFP, FAO, UNICEF, and Bangladesh Red Crescent Society for disaster response.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 6; EQ4, Claim 5"
"Conclusion 2. The LNOB principle was intentionally pursued through targeted actions focusing on marginalized groups and vulnerable districts, delivering notable localized gains. However, despite progress in advocating with the MoHFW, national routine health data systems (specifically the Government Health MIS) often lacked consistent disaggregation for key LNOB dimensions (particularly disability), limiting the ability to rigorously verify equity results at scale. Integration of LNOB approaches varied across settings and partners due to uneven capacities, leading to inconsistent uptake of gender equality, disability inclusion, and youth participation. Humanitarian responses showed stronger coherence than non-emergency contexts. National evidence generation improved, but weak interoperability and gaps in administrative data continued to make it difficult to show how program benefits were distributed across different LNOB groups (e.g., disproportionate benefits to ethnic minorities versus persons with disabilities). ",The 10 priority districts for CP10 were selected through rigorous analysis by the M&E Unit of key indicators.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1"
,"UNFPA selects low-performing districts, considering marginalized groups, remoteness, and disability, for targeted support in maternal and child health.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ5, Claim 11.1"
,"The strategic focus on low-performing districts and vulnerable groups (including those facing geographical, economic, or cultural barriers, and persons with disabilities) for targeted support is highly relevant to achieving lagging SDG goals and 'leaving no one behind' (LNOB).","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1"
,"To ensure the Leave No One Behind (LNOB) approach, UNFPA deployed midwives to the most marginalised indigenous communities, such as the Santal in Gaibandha.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ1, Claim 3"
,"The UNFPA-supported Census 2022 included questions specifically targeting vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as Persons with Disabilities (POD) and transgender populations, to generate disaggregated data.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 3; EQ1, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 3; EQ4, Claim 1"
,"A significant and persistent data gap exists for disaggregated data, particularly concerning persons with disabilities, which remains largely unavailable within the national health information system (DHIS2).","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ1, Claim 12; EQ4, Claim 1; EQ4, Claim 3; EQ4, Claim 5; EQ6, Claim 6"
,"Despite effective advocacy leading to the integration of some UNFPA priority indicators into the national health information system (DHIS2), a significant data gap persists, particularly concerning disaggregated data for persons with disabilities.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 3; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ4, Claim 1; EQ4, Claim 4"
,"Visibility for indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and transgender/gender-diverse people remains inconsistent, suggesting that progress is challenging.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 11; EQ3, Claim 8; EQ4, Claim 3; EQ4, Claim 5"
,"UNFPA IPs often collect sex, age, and disability data for reporting, but lack the capacity to use this information for adaptive programming or resource targeting.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ3, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 2; EQ3, Claim 5; EQ4, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 5; EQ6, Claim 6"
,"A significant gap was noted where nearly zero percentage of staff in Women Friendly Spaces (WFS) received dedicated training on disability inclusion, which limits the effective uptake of services by women with disabilities.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 10"
,"With the existing data, it is not possible to determine whether the most marginalized and vulnerable groups benefited the most from UNFPA interventions.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 11.3"
,"Application of LNOB principle, cross-cutting approaches and data disaggregation by vulnerabilities is widespread but not yet systematic everywhere, and current data are insufficient to verify that LNOB groups benefited most.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 11.6"
,"LNOB and other cross-cutting approaches are embedded in SOPs, planning tools, and supervision and are applied in most development and humanitarian interventions; however, consistent operationalization for persons with disabilities and other marginalized populations remains uneven across districts.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 11.6"
"Conclusion 3. Strong strategic alignment with national and global priorities underpinned UNFPA's normative role, successfully translating evidence into national policies and standards. However, the sustained uptake of these specific policies and standards in routine practice and their consistent inclusion in multi-year government budgets and spending remained uneven, limiting the national scale and long-term durability of the change. ","UNFPA programs are highly aligned with Bangladesh's national SDG goals, targets, and operational plans for health, child health, SRHR, and gender-based violence.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 1; EQ2, Claim 1"
,"The 10th Country Program (2022-2026) aims to contribute to the three transformative results (reduction of maternal mortality, unmet need for family planning, and gender-based violence/child marriage).","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ1, Claim 8"
,CP (SRHR) is aligned with national policies including i) National Population Policy ; ii) 4th Health and Population and Nutrition Sector Program (HPNSP); iii) Government’s Commitment on FP2030; iv) 8th Five Year Pan ; v) 8th Five Year Plan ; vi) The UNDSCF and viii) The SDGs.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 4"
,"UNFPA provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) for updating the National Population Policy 2012, shifting its focus from population control to population management in line with SDGs, ICPD PoA, Perspective Plan (2041), and the Delta Plan (2100).","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 4; EQ3, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 1; EQ6, Claim 6.1"
,The first ever Bangladesh National Family Planning Strategy (2023-2030) was formulated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with support from UNFPA.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 3; EQ6, Claim 6.1; EQ4, Claim 1"
,"UNFPA contributed 90% to midwifery policy documents, including national guidelines, SOPs, job descriptions, and deployment policies, crucial for both education and service delivery.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 5; EQ3, Claim 1; EQ3, Claim 3; EQ6, Claim 6.1; EQ4, Claim 3"
,"The Labor Room Protocol, a ""significant"" third edition developed with UNFPA's assistance, aims to significantly reduce maternal and infant mortality upon implementation.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 6; EQ1, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 1; EQ3, Claim 3; EQ6, Claim 6.1"
,"Policy formulation is strong, but enforcement and systems are weak. Chronic stock-outs of commodities, legal barriers to staff recruitment, and loopholes in child marriage law persist.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ6, Claim 4; EQ5, Claim 10.4"
,"The DGHS Official points to a significant shortage of skilled human resources at the field level (half-empty) as a major bottleneck, hindering the scale-up of quality services.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ3, Claim 2; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 2; EQ6, Claim 4"
,"The DGNM trains midwives but lacks control over service delivery infrastructure (DG Health controls the ""house""). This creates a big integration issue that needs to be thought about at the Ministry level.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ3, Claim 7; EQ3, Claim 5; EQ6, Claim 2; EQ6, Claim 4"
,"Only 2,500 midwives have been deployed in the last 10 years, drastically short of the 22,000 target by 2030, limiting service delivery impact.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 2; EQ5, Claim 10.4"
"Conclusion 4. Sustainability and the shift from project-based funding to diversified, domestically anchored financing have advanced but remain fragile. Institutionalization is visible in standards and system use, yet continuity is vulnerable where public financing is inconsistent, execution lags persist, and equity-related costs are not routinely tracked and protected. ","The shift from funding to financing is evident, as the government is increasingly taking financial ownership, now covering midwifery student stipends and internship allowances from its revenue fund.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.1; EQ5, Claim 12.1"
,"UNFPA explicitly designs interventions as pilots, expecting the government to scale them up into national Development Project Proposals.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.1; EQ5, Claim 12.1"
,"The Komolful Pharmacy initiative is designed as a self-sustaining business model, aiming for long-term viability without external funding.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 4; EQ4, Claim 2; EQ5, Claim 12.6"
,"Fistula and MPDSR programs rely heavily on UNFPA's limited internal funds and grants, facing significant funding gaps due to low donor interest.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 6"
,"The Sapmara project in the Shantaal community, which significantly Informant at Sapmara UH&FWC, Transcripts increased institutional deliveries, faces severe doubt about its sustainability as it ends in December 2025.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 2"
,"Budget allocation is insufficient, leading to service gaps and reliance on short-term funding and community contributions. There is chronic underfunding for GBV prevention... and national stockouts of family planning commodities.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.4"
,The absence of an approved government Operation Plan causes critical shortages of essential medicines and logistics in the field.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 2; EQ6, Claim 5"
,"Resource distribution across thematic areas is uneven, with funding and staff concentrated in donor-priority districts and humanitarian hotspots, leading to inequitable access and variable implementation quality.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ4, Claim 6"
,"Execution gaps in budget performance, HR/logistics and uneven subnational capacity slow translation from policy to practice...","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.4"
,"Crucially, comprehensive national monitoring of LNOB adherence is challenged by persistent data gaps for disaggregated information, particularly concerning persons with disabilities, in the national health information system (DHIS2).","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.4; EQ5, Claim 11.4"
"Conclusion 5. Innovation is a clear comparative advantage for UNFPA, successfully accelerating progress (e.g., Komolful Pharmacy, Block-chain, WHDs). However, this success is not yet systematic: it is not consistently embedded in the Programme's strategic positioning. System-wide adoption is held back by project fragmentation and the absence of a structured pathway, requiring clear policy uptake, dedicated funding, transition of successful pilots to replication and government budget inclusion. ","UNFPA launched a partnership with Zaynax Health, Impact Hub Dhaka, Gram Unnayan Karma, and ToguMogu to expand access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning services for women by offering training and mentorship to woman pharmacist entrepreneurs.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 4; EQ4, Claim 2"
,"The Komolful Pharmacy initiative is designed as a self-sustaining business model, aiming for long-term viability without external funding.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 4; EQ4, Claim 2; EQ5, Claim 12.6"
,"WFP, FAO, and UNFPA are using blockchain to reach low-income women in the urban slums with food aid and information about menstrual health management and gender-based violence.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 4; EQ4, Claim 3"
,"UNFPA set up and supported a total of 120 facilities, including 27 Women’s Help Desks at Police Stations.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ3, Claim 4"
,"UNFPA works in urban slums, providing midwife-led care, contraceptives, and using a mobile app (Ma-Jaan) for emergency referrals to address difficult SRHR access.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 4"
,"The lack of a clear plan for government takeover and sustainability of donor-supported programs once funding ends creates ""big gaps"" and service discontinuation.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ6, Claim 4"
,"Strategic platforms exist and facilitate dialogue, but budgetary/resource integration is weak; uneven resource distribution across thematic areas.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 2; EQ3, Claim 7"
,"All intervention taken by A&Y team was not mentioned in the TOC. For example integrating Sombhabona program with Jibikayon and VWB was not in TOC. However, keepin the theme of og outcome and intervention in mind, interventions have been adapted.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 4"
"Conclusion 6. Integration of megatrends (such as climate change and aging populations) is successful in localized pilots but remains unsystematic due to the absence of institutional mechanisms. While progress is visible in specific initiatives, the necessary anticipation and adaptation (i.e., forward-looking risk-informed strategic framework and adjustments) are not consistently applied across thematic areas or system levels to institutionalize the megatrends across all routine programming. ","UNFPA integrates climate change issues into training and services, responding to the megatrend and its impact on vulnerable communities.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 1"
,The DGNM integrates climate change issues and care for persons with disabilities and the elderly into midwifery and nursing training programs.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 6"
,UNFPA addresses the aging population megatrend by exploring geriatric care at the upazila level and integrating elderly care into midwife/nurse training.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ2, Claim 1"
,"UNFPA developed training modules on climate change and SRHR for healthcare providers, integrating it into the midwifery curriculum.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 6"
,"The program includes MISP for disaster situations and works with vulnerable, disaster-prone groups in areas like Sunamganj and Cox's Bazar.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ1, Claim 6"
,UNFPA distributed dignity kits to vulnerable families in flood-prone districts as anticipatory disaster relief.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ1, Claim 6"
,"Evidence of ToCs directly driving field-level adaptation to all megatrends is limited, with climate and migration addressed more superficially than gender and youth.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ4, Claim 3"
,"Resource distribution across thematic areas is uneven, with funding and staff concentrated in donor-priority districts and humanitarian hotspots, leading to inequitable access and variable implementation quality.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ4, Claim 6"
,"The M&E system could be more geared towards the assessment of results for vulnerable groups, including disaggregation of data by sex, age and province/district. This seems to be a weak area needing some attention to achieve “no one left behind” objectives by 2030.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 12; EQ2, Claim 2; EQ4, Claim 5; EQ4, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 6"
"Conclusion 7. Delivery stayed resilient during shocks through agile resequencing and flexible resource use. However, chronic execution bottlenecks undermined timeliness, cost-efficiency, and equity, especially in hard-to-reach districts. Stop-start delivery, late-year spending spikes, and uneven subnational performance persisted where approval, cash, and supply-chain dissonance were unresolved. ",Issues include limited availability of reproductive services in disaster-prone coastal areas and vulnerable housing.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1"
,UNFPA distributed dignity kits to vulnerable families in flood-prone districts as anticipatory disaster relief.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 1; EQ1, Claim 6"
,"In response to floods in Chattogram, UNFPA provided dignity kits, MHM kits, and baby kits to 12,000 women and 6,120 girls, including those with disabilities and transgender women.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 4"
,The absence of an approved government Operation Plan causes critical shortages of essential medicines and logistics in the field.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ3, Claim 6; EQ6, Claim 2; EQ6, Claim 5"
,"Chronic stock-outs of commodities, legal barriers to staff recruitment, and loopholes in child marriage law (e.g., fake birth certificates, unregistered marriages) persist.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 9; EQ6, Claim 4; EQ5, Claim 10.4"
,"Remote island and hard-to-reach communities (e.g., Saint Martin’s, Kutubdia, Maheshkhali) remain underserved.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 11; EQ3, Claim 8; EQ4, Claim 3; EQ6, Claim 2"
,"The operations team reported that midwifery deployment is taking place... but challenges in retaining midwives at the field level persist, alongside under-resourcing for essential services and **delays in the procurement of programme supplies.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.5; EQ5, Claim 12.4"
,"Due to the bureaucratic process in approving the Government's Technical Assistance Project Proposal (TAPP), the CO could not sign workplans with some government IPs.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.4"
"Conclusion 8. UNFPA-supported midwifery and maternal health models deliver effective, high-quality care and provide a credible national normative model. However, scaling these models to routine national coverage is constrained by human-resource shortfalls and subnational capacity gaps. ","UNFPA significantly supports midwifery, a government priority for achieving SDG targets for maternal and newborn mortality and making SRHR services available.","Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ1, Claim 8; EQ3, Claim 1"

"Conclusion 9. GBV service models are effective and survivor-centred, backed by a stronger evidence base and policy gains. However, continuity and completion were limited by funding shortfalls and weak anchoring in domestic budgets. ",UNFPA enhanced survivor-centered services by increasing the number of facilities providing GBV response from 0 in 2021 to 143 in 2023.,"Evaluation Matrix based on findings.pdf, EQ5, Claim 10.1; EQ5, Claim 10.3"
